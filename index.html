This means: The machine does not replace the human, but complements his capabilities and relieves him of arduous tasks. These can include overhead work, for example, or the lifting of heavy loads. Autonomous, collaborative robots are also used to supply production workstations</p>

        <p class="r4_2">Hitting the show floor at CES can be something of a challenge. There are so many choices, it’s almost impossible to figure out where to even start. So this year, I got to narrow my focus to just one area — robotics — and it made my job a lot easier. Or it should have. Turns out, there are so many choices in the field of robotics, I was back where I started. </p>

Young people in these towns are moving on to the brighter job prospects. And technology is taking over what’s left of the mining industry.
